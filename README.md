# Next.js Affiliate Marketing Template with Directus Integration

This is a **Next.js-based Affiliate Marketing Template** fully integrated with [Directus](https://directus.io/). Based on the robust CMS Starter, this version is supercharged with affiliate-specific tools (like product-comparisions tables), privacy-first analytics (**Matomo**), and legal compliance integration (**CMP**).

It offers a scalable solution for building high-conversion review sites, blogs, and comparison portals while maintaining full data ownership and GDPR compliance.

## **Features**

### Core Tech Stack

  - **Next.js App Router**: Uses the latest routing architecture for layouts and dynamic performance.
  - **Full Directus Integration**: Manage content, affiliate links, and relational data via the Directus API.
  - **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn**: Rapid UI styling with pre-built, customizable modern components.
  - **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and reliable code quality.

### 🚀 Affiliate & Marketing Enhancements

  - **Matomo Analytics Integration**: Built-in, privacy-friendly tracking. configured to track page views and outbound affiliate clicks automatically.
  - **Consent Management Platform (CMP)**: Pre-configured logic for CMP scripts (e.g., Cookiebot, Usercentrics) to handle GDPR/CCPA compliance.
  - **Conversion-Focused Blocks**: Includes specific CMS blocks for **Comparison Tables**, **Pros/Cons Lists**, and **Sticky CTA Headers**.
  - **Smart Link Management**: Centralized management of affiliate links via Directus to easily swap URLs across the site.
  - **Optimized Dependency Management**: Project is set up with **pnpm** for speed and efficiency.

## **Why pnpm?**

This project uses `pnpm` for managing dependencies due to its speed and efficiency. If you’re familiar with `npm`, you’ll find `pnpm` very similar in usage. You can still use `npm` if you prefer by replacing `pnpm` commands with their `npm` equivalents.

## **Analytics & Compliance**

### **Matomo Integration**

This template comes pre-wired for Matomo. Unlike Google Analytics, Matomo allows for 100% data ownership—crucial for affiliate marketers.

  - **Event Tracking**: Automatically tags outbound clicks on affiliate links with `data-track-content`.
  - **Privacy**: Configurable to run in cookie-less mode or wait for CMP consent.

### **CMP (Consent Management)**

A dedicated script loader is included to inject your Consent Management Platform (CMP) of choice. This ensures your affiliate cookies and tracking scripts are only loaded after user consent, keeping you compliant with EU/US regulations.

-----

## **Draft Mode & Live Preview**

Directus allows you to work on unpublished content using **Draft Mode**. This template supports:

  - **Real-time Editing**: See changes to your affiliate reviews or comparison tables instantly.
  - **Security**: Uses a secure token to allow previews even on production builds without exposing draft content to the public.

*See [Directus Live Preview Guide](https://docs.directus.io/guides/headless-cms/live-preview/nextjs.html) for deep-dive configuration.*
